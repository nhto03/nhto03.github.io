    <h1>Challenge: Design a Band </h1>
    
    <h2> Challenge information</h2>
    
    <p>---What is design thinking? Why are we studying it?<br>
     ---What are the steps of the DEEP design thinking process?<br>
    ---Summarize the steps that we did in 
    class to make the album cover.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>Design thinking is the process in which you try to figure 
    out what people like and try to put that into your work. 
    Knowing how to do this is quite important since it'll make 
    people more likely to want your product and will help you in 
    future jobs. To find out what people want you need to ask them.
    Go survey people and find all the things they look for. After
    that you can use information that was gathered to make the 
    final product. This is exactly what I did. I surveyed
    our classmates to find out what most of them liked. The 
    results I got was that all the people I interviewed liked
     seriff font. I also found two people that like realism while
    one liked abstract. Also most liked dark colors like black and
    grey but some liked something lighter like white. Then we used a random wikipedia
    page generator to generate band names and song names. Then we
    found a picture that matched the result of our surveys for
    what people wanted. And then we edited the photo to have the 
    names of our band and song and that was our album cover. But
    I still had steps to complete. A-B testing.I made another 
    album and asked people which liked and after they voted I used
    the one with the most votes. Then to check if they didn't like 
    any details, I did the rose, thorn, and bud tesitng. I got mixed
    results with some people liking the color scheme while others 
    didn't. After that I made some small changes and the final product 
    was my album cover.

    <h2>Album Cover</h2>
  
  <img src="./img/portfolio/design_a_band/albumcover.png">
  <h2> Band Biography</h2>
  <p>There are 5 members that formed their band in their college 
  days in a town in Switzerland. They spent their days making punk 
  classical music and called their band Rusted Metal. However as
  they grew up they hit harder times and could support themselves
  with just music. They took on different jobs and had a hard time
  making music. However they became lucky one day and was able to
  get a great gig in their most desperate of times. They became a
  huge hit and was able to live more comfortably. They found this
  abrupt change almost laughable and decided to rename their band 
  Dark Hope since they found hope at the darkest of times and the 
  album they made was called Life is a Jest since now their life
  is comfortable and fun like a game. The picture of the album was
  the building where they had their life changing gig. They were
  at their darkest but the building still stood tall and welcomed 
  them.
